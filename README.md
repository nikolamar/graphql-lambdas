Apollo client + micro-services architecture
==============

### Microservices architecture:

Someone came up with a similar idea like mine before me and I don't want to repeat it, there is everything in the article. There are some differences because here we are using lambdas and they don't. Check this link for more info it will be more clear after reading this article: https://www.habx.com/tech/micro-graphql-schema

This repo shows this architecture that uses microservices and domains structure and it uses lambda layers to share a common schema, logic, and nodejs dependencies. If your projects demands you can bundle some lambdas or all of them and you don't need to share `node_modules` at all if you don't want to. Whatever works for you. There is a `sam sync` which updates you lambda code on the fly even if you are writing `typescript` it takes max 5 seconds. Bundling is faster now each lambda is package and sam beta uses now esbuild. It is more convenient now as we don't have to use our esbuild scripts.

Key things to take here:

- no single point of failure
- each lambda can be tweaked independent as they are intended to
- split your backend into domains e.g. users, tenants, etc.
- sync your local code with sam cli watch and it will deploy code to lambda under 5 sec.
- local works even better now (if it is one graphql lambda all requests are processed over one adapter this is not an issue anymore)
- you can write graphql lambdas in nodejs and other in go and they can share same schema
- github actions can trigger auto release like this:
```
git push origin
git tag v0.3.2
git push origin v0.3.2
```
You'll get this:

### Stages:

This project has 2 stages:

1. `dev`
2. `prod`

You can add more in github actions.

### Scripts:

1. Deploy script requires secret keys to deploy:

```
#!/bin/bash

MY_DIR=$(realpath $0)
CICD_DIR=$(dirname $MY_DIR)
PROJECT_ROOT=$(dirname $CICD_DIR)

export PROJECT_NAME=${PROJECT_NAME:-app-name}
export AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID=$AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID
export AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY=$AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY
export GOOGLE_CLIENT_ID=$GOOGLE_CLIENT_ID
export GOOGLE_CLIENT_SECRET=$GOOGLE_CLIENT_SECRET

# These vars are needed to inject into the SAM template
export STAGE=$STAGE
export REGION=$REGION
export DB_USER=$DB_USER
export DB_PASSWORD=$DB_PASSWORD
export HOSTED_ZONE_ID=$HOSTED_ZONE_ID
export DOMAIN_NAME=${DOMAIN_NAME:-fakedomain.com}
export SUB_DOMAIN_NAME=$SUB_DOMAIN_NAME
export VERSION=$VERSION

...

```

### Prepare your local `environment`:

1. Make sure you install `AWS SAM CLI`:

https://docs.aws.amazon.com/serverless-application-model/latest/developerguide/serverless-sam-cli-install.html

2. Set up AWS Credentials and Region for Development:

https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/latest/userguide/cli-configure-files.html

3. Update your `env.json` with secrets like this:

```
{
  "Parameters": {
    "STAGE": "dev",
    "REGION": "us-east-1",
    "DB_USER": "admin",
    "DB_NAME": "users",
    "DB_PASSWORD": "password",
    "POOL_ID": "us-east-1_keycYdErq",
    "WEBSOCKETE_API_ID": "wss://1kdtq8enmy.execute-api.us-east-1.amazonaws.com/dev",
    "CLIENT_ID": "9gherqopxfbwta63gtsheuwrsq",
    "NODE_ENV": "local",
    "VERSION": "v0.0.0",
    "AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID": "HYAQPLMDNCGTERAYQTEY",
    "AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY": "u0o/50HJHgjhJKhGHGGGu+JhjHJhJgjkGHJGKjHUH/ZI",
    "GoogleClientId": "08759380566757-346606lnfbhd8986sd8fi23gr8h9l.apps.googleusercontent.com",
    "GoogleClientSecret": "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"
  }
}

```

### Running in `sync`:

1. This will sync your local code changes with deployed lambda while you editing the `ts` source files it takes a max 5 seconds to update lambda:

```sam sync â€”beta-features ```

`NOTE: it will ask for app name (stack name on AWS) to sync your code.`

### Running in `local`:

1. Build `lambdas from template` with AWS SAM CLI running beta features that introduce esbuild:
```
sam build --beta-features
```

2. Start local APIs using docker containers:

```
sam local start-api --warm-containers LAZY --skip-pull-image --host 0.0.0.0 --env-vars env.json --port 3000
```

3. `TODO:` For hot reload we need a simple esbuild script here to watch changes and copy files to `.aws-sam/build` where all `javascript` transformed lambdas sit or run the esbuild CLI command with watch option.

### Runing on `frontend`:

1. Update queries and mutations with graphql directives:

Schema has to be updated with `@api(name: users)`:
```
query users ($where: UserFilter, $order: Order, $first: Int, $offset: Int, $after: String, $sortBy: String) @api(name: users) {
  users (where: $where, order: $order, first: $first, offset: $offset, after: $after, sortBy: $sortBy) {
    edges {
      cursor
      node {
        ...UserFragment
      }
    }
    pageInfo {
      hasPreviousPage
      hasNextPage
      startCursor
      endCursor
      count
      totalCount
    }
  }
}
```

2. Install:

```
npm i @habx/apollo-multi-endpoint-link
```

3. Setup:
```
import { createHttpLink } from "apollo-link-http";

new ApolloClient({
 link: ApolloLink.from([
   new MultiAPILink({
       httpSuffix: "",
       endpoints: {
           users: 'https://fake.domain.com/users',
           tenants: 'https://fake.domain.com/tenants',
           ...
       },
       createHttpLink: () => createHttpLink(),
     }),
 ])
})
```
